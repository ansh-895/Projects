# Freelancer_Portal

A web application developed using React.js and CSS. The purpose of the project is to provide with freelancers 
and clients a common platform to interact. Both the parties will create an account and a portfolio
on the portal. The freelancer would list their skills and the client would post job listings.
This would help both of them connect.
